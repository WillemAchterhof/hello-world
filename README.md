# hello-world
My first GitHub Repository
I am Willem, born in the Netherlands but living in Japan with my wife and daughter.
I started to learn c# just because I was interested in it, but soon I found myself following a course on https://bobtabor.thinkific.com/, and after watching some Youtube I found out about GitHub and that its important.
